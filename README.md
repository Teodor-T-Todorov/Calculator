# Calculator app

### Description
A calculator web app that includes all basic operations (+, -, *, /, %), brackets for priority of the operation and decimal numbers.
The app takes the user input as an array of characters and with the help of functions it returns a single number.


### Functionality
- Concatenation of numbers. Takes an array and concatenates the numbers. 

  **ex. ['1', '2', '+', '3'] -> ['12' '+' '3']**

- Operate. Takes 2 operands and 1 operator and returns the result from the operation. Used as a help function to calculate complex expressions.

   **ex. operate(+, 1, 2) -> 3**

- Calculate. Takes the whole user input and calculate it

  **ex. ['(', '1', '+', '2', ')', '*', '2'] -> 6**
  
### Goals from the project
- Learn to manipulate complex array structure.
- Implement brackets (it was quite challenging).
